title: Week Eight :8

**What did I do this past week?** 

I can barely remember what happened this past week, but looking back at my calendar, I did my algo homework, some interviews, made refreshments for my Bible study group, started on the allocator project and met with my lean in circle. The allocator project seemed to be pretty easy, Jasper and I spent about 3 hours on Wednesday night working on constructor, allocate and valid. Then we worked for another 4 hours on Thursday. We finished implementing all the required methods but got stuck on a Valgrind "conditional jump depend on an uninitialized variable" warning for 3 hours. It turned out to be some out of bounds problems. We thought things were going well, then we realized on Friday that all the test cases we wrote failed. Jasper found out there were issues in coalescing free blocks because I somehow thought negative sentinel value means the block is free. Oops. But after all the debugging, our project is finally at a state that's ready to be tested. In class, we talked about array and how user defined types behave differentely than built in types. And I got called on for the second time in my life! Yay :D  

**What's in my way?**

Always number theory. It's actually getting better, since Dr. Blumberg and other students in the class are very helpful. I am struggling a little less now! But there's an exam this Tuesday... hopefully everything will be okay :)


**What will I do next week?**

Write unit tests for allocator, study for number theory exam, interview prep and hold more office hours for OS if I have time!


**Tip of The Week**

BRING A JACKET IF YOU WANT TO WORK IN THE LAB. My friend tried to turn the temperature up to 90 degrees on every controller, but the lab was still freezing. Lab at night = freezing.
