title: Week Five :3
---

**What did I do this past week?** 

I stayed for the entire career fair, handed out 21 resumes, and talked to 20 plus companies. It was the first time in three years that I was able to catch the last bus to campus. Not having to walk back after career fair was so nice. I also finished algo homework 5 minutes before it's due and resubmitted the netflix project 30 minutes before it's due :p Turning in OOP projects has always been stressful because there are so many files to keep track of. Hopefully, I can get better at it! Also, shout out to my partner Eric Lee for bringing me food from company talks almost every day this past week :p I highly recommend him if anyone is looking for a partner in the future :) The highlights of this past week were the JPL talk and my VMware interview. I've heard from my roommate that JPL is modeling Mars, but seeing the actual demo and hearing how they work was still amazing! I've had a chance to play with HoloLens a bit over the summer, but I didn't realize how much potential it has. Seeing how JPL used HoloLens to bring out a better representation of Mars helped me understand that these Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality tools are actually very useful. My other highlight was interviewing with the senior manager of the VMware kernel team. His knowledge on systems and understanding of people is just unbelievable. I was lucky enough to spend an hour and 30 minutes with him and learn from him. I will definitely take more classes, spend more time looking through the linux kernel, and get more experience in systems development!


**What's in my way?**

Applied Number Theory. The class is very hard, demanding a lot of time. I've been going to the professor's office hours but still struggling so much... Algorithm exam is also coming up... 


**What will I do next week?**

I will finish my Applied Number Theory homework that's due last Friday, prepare for interviews, study for Algorithms exam, do the OOP readings, and make sure I understand the OOP materials so I can do better on the quizzes. I will also try to be less stressed, eat more and sleep more this week! I am also going to my church retreat this weekend, really looking forward to it! :)


**Tip of The Week**

For people who are interested in learning more about the linux kernel, I found [Linux Kernel Newbies](https://kernelnewbies.org/) to be quite helpful. This [tutorial](https://kernelnewbies.org/FirstKernelPatch) is a good place to start, and more information can be found [here](https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelHacking).
