**What did I do this past week?** 

I spent most of my time this week preparing for an interview and the OOP exam. Since it's the first exam, and the list of topics to review was so long, I wasn't sure what to focus on. Some of the STL algorithms weren't covered in class, but were in the list of things to know, so I looked them up and found some clever implementation. I went through all the notes and implemented transform, accumulate, fill and copy right before the exam, and luckily that paid off for the first two problems. The cheat sheet really wasn't that useful for the exam :p Overall I think exam one went okay, although I overlooked something and made a mistake, the exam itself was pretty fair. Besides the exam, we covered 4 different pointers in c++. int *, const int *, int const *, and const int const *. I remember learning these in the c++ class a year ago but not really understanding them. Going over when to use which pointers helped me a lot with understanding them.


**What's in my way?**

NUMBER THEORY... and interviews and life in general :( I wish there are 30 hours a day so I can sleep a little more.


**What will I do next week?**

I will finish my Applied Number Theory homework that's due three Fridays ago, prepare for interviews and start on the allocator project! P3 sounds interesting, can't wait to start!
